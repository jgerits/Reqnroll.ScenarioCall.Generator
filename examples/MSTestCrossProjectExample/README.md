# MSTest Cross-Project Example - Reqnroll Scenario Call Generator

This example demonstrates how to **call scenarios from another project** within the same solution using the Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator plugin.

## üéØ What This Example Demonstrates

This example shows a real-world pattern where:
- **SharedAuthLibrary** - A shared test library containing reusable authentication scenarios
- **MSTestCrossProjectExample** (this project) - References SharedAuthLibrary and calls its scenarios

This pattern is useful for:
- **Sharing common test scenarios** across multiple test projects
- **Creating reusable test libraries** for authentication, data setup, etc.
- **Maintaining consistency** across different test suites
- **Team collaboration** where different teams own different shared libraries

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

```

## üîß How Cross-Project Scenario Calling Works

### Step 1: Project Reference

The `.csproj` file includes a project reference to SharedAuthLibrary:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- Reference the shared authentication library -->
  <ProjectReference Include="..\SharedAuthLibrary\SharedAuthLibrary.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

**What this does:**
- Makes SharedAuthLibrary's step definitions available to this project
- Allows dependency injection to work across projects
- Enables compilation and build order management

### Step 2: Make Feature Files Available

The **critical configuration** that enables cross-project scenario calling is making the feature files available to the generator. 

In this example, we **physically copied** the feature files from SharedAuthLibrary:
```bash
# From MSTestCrossProjectExample directory
mkdir -p Features/SharedAuth
cp ../SharedAuthLibrary/Features/*.feature Features/SharedAuth/
```

Then mark them as reference-only using the `ReqnrollFeatureReference` item type:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- 
    Mark SharedAuth feature files as references only.
    The ReqnrollFeatureReference item type is provided by JGerits.Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator
    and automatically excludes these files from test code generation.
  -->
  <ReqnrollFeatureReference Include="Features\SharedAuth\*.feature">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </ReqnrollFeatureReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

**That's it!** The `ReqnrollFeatureReference` item type (introduced in version 3.1.4) automatically:
- Prevents Reqnroll from generating test code for these files
- Ensures the files are still copied to the output directory
- Makes the files available for the ScenarioCall.Generator to read during expansion

**Why is this needed?**

The Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator plugin searches for feature files in the current project's directory structure during build-time code generation. By making the feature files available:

1. **Discovery**: The generator can find the feature files to read scenario definitions
2. **Expansion**: Scenario calls are expanded inline during code generation
3. **Build-time Processing**: No runtime dependencies on external feature files
4. **No Test Duplication**: The `ReqnrollFeatureReference` item prevents generating duplicate test methods for the copied feature files

**Alternative: MSBuild Link**

Alternatively, you can use MSBuild to include files without physically copying them:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ReqnrollFeatureReference Include="..\SharedAuthLibrary\Features\*.feature">
    <Link>Features\SharedAuth\%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </ReqnrollFeatureReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

This keeps files synchronized automatically but may have platform compatibility issues.

### Step 3: Call Scenarios from Other Projects

In your feature files, reference scenarios from the shared library:

```gherkin
Feature: Order Management

Scenario: Place Order as Authenticated User
    # This scenario call references the SharedAuthLibrary project
    # The scenario is expanded at build time by the generator plugin
    Given I call scenario "Login with Valid Credentials" from feature "Shared Authentication"
    When I navigate to the products page
    And I add "Widget" to cart
    And I proceed to checkout
    Then I should see order confirmation
```

**How the expansion works:**

1. **Before expansion** (what you write):
   ```gherkin
   Given I call scenario "Login with Valid Credentials" from feature "Shared Authentication"
   ```

2. **After expansion** (what the generator creates):
   ```gherkin
   # Expanded from scenario call: "Login with Valid Credentials" from feature "Shared Authentication"
   Given I am on the login page
   When I enter username "john.doe@example.com"
   And I enter password "SecurePassword123"
   And I click the login button
   Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
   And I should see "Welcome, John Doe" message
   ```

3. **Generated code**: The expanded steps are compiled into the test methods

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider (optional)

### Option 1: Using the Examples Solution

Open the `Examples.sln` file in the parent examples folder:

```bash
cd ..
start Examples.sln  # Windows
# or
open Examples.sln   # macOS
# or
code Examples.sln   # VS Code
```

### Option 2: Building from Command Line

1. **Restore dependencies** (both projects):
   ```bash
   cd ../SharedAuthLibrary
   dotnet restore
   cd ../MSTestCrossProjectExample
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
   
   During the build, you'll see:
   - SharedAuthLibrary is built first (dependency order)
   - Feature files are copied to this project
   - The ScenarioCall.Generator expands scenario calls
   - Test code is generated with expanded steps

3. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## üîç Verifying the Expansion

After building, you can verify that scenario calls were expanded:

1. **Check the generated code**:
   ```bash
   # View the generated test file for OrderManagement
   cat Features/OrderManagement.feature.cs
   ```

2. **Look for expanded steps**: You should see the authentication steps inline in the generated test methods

3. **Check build output**: Look for messages from the Reqnroll generator during build

## üí° Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Cross-Project Scenario Reuse

```gherkin
# Call a scenario from SharedAuthLibrary
Given I call scenario "Login with Valid Credentials" from feature "Shared Authentication"
```

### 2. Step Definition Sharing

Step definitions from SharedAuthLibrary are automatically available:
- `SharedAuthenticationSteps` are discovered through project reference
- No need to duplicate authentication step definitions
- Dependency injection works seamlessly across projects

### 3. Scenario Context Sharing

The `ScenarioContext` is shared across projects:
```csharp
// In SharedAuthLibrary
_scenarioContext["LoggedIn"] = true;

// In MSTestCrossProjectExample (can access the same context)
if (!_scenarioContext.ContainsKey("LoggedIn"))
{
    throw new Exception("User must be logged in");
}
```

### 4. Multiple Feature Files

The project demonstrates calling scenarios from shared libraries in multiple feature files:
- `OrderManagement.feature` - Order processing with authentication
- `ProductReviews.feature` - Product reviews with authentication

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. **Organize Shared Libraries**

Create dedicated projects for commonly reused scenarios:
- `SharedAuthLibrary` - Authentication and authorization
- `SharedDataSetupLibrary` - Test data creation
- `SharedNavigationLibrary` - Common navigation scenarios

### 2. **Clear Feature Naming**

Use descriptive feature names that won't conflict:
- ‚úÖ "Shared Authentication" (clear origin)
- ‚úÖ "Common Data Setup" (clear purpose)
- ‚ùå "Authentication" (could be ambiguous)
- ‚ùå "Login" (too generic)

### 3. **Document Cross-Project Dependencies**

Add comments in your `.csproj` file explaining why features are copied:
```xml
<!-- Copy SharedAuthLibrary feature files for scenario call expansion -->
<None Include="..\SharedAuthLibrary\Features\*.feature">
  <Link>Features\SharedAuth\%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>
</None>
```

### 4. **Version Control**

When using shared libraries:
- Keep shared libraries in the same solution
- Use project references (not assembly references)
- Version shared libraries alongside consuming projects

### 5. **Test Isolation**

Ensure scenarios in shared libraries:
- Don't have side effects that impact other tests
- Reset state appropriately
- Use ScenarioContext for test-specific state

### 6. **Avoid Deep Nesting**

Don't create chains of scenario calls:
- ‚ùå Scenario A calls Scenario B, which calls Scenario C
- ‚úÖ Scenario A calls Scenario B directly
- The plugin doesn't recursively expand nested scenario calls

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not expand scenario call"

**Cause**: The feature file from SharedAuthLibrary wasn't copied correctly.

**Solution**: 
1. Check the `.csproj` file has the `<None Include>` configuration
2. Verify the path to SharedAuthLibrary feature files is correct
3. Clean and rebuild: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`

### Issue: "Step definition not found"

**Cause**: The project reference to SharedAuthLibrary is missing or incorrect.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the `<ProjectReference>` in `.csproj` is correct
2. Check that SharedAuthLibrary builds successfully
3. Ensure both projects target the same framework (.NET 8.0)

### Issue: "Feature not found"

**Cause**: The feature name in the scenario call doesn't match the SharedAuthLibrary feature name.

**Solution**:
- Feature name must match the `Feature:` line exactly (case-insensitive)
- Check SharedAuthLibrary/Features/SharedAuthentication.feature
- Verify: `Feature: Shared Authentication` matches `from feature "Shared Authentication"`

### Issue: Build succeeds but tests fail

**Cause**: ScenarioContext state expectations mismatch.

**Solution**:
- Review which context keys SharedAuthLibrary sets
- Ensure your step definitions check for required context keys
- Add defensive checks for context values

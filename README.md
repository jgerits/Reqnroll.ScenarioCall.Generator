A powerful Reqnroll generator plugin that enables calling and embedding scenarios from other feature files directly within your test scenarios. This plugin promotes test reusability, modularity, and better organization of your Gherkin specifications.

## Features

- üîÑ **Scenario Reusability**: Call existing scenarios from any feature file
- üéØ **Inline Expansion**: Automatically expands scenario calls during test generation
- üóÇÔ∏è **Cross-Feature Support**: Reference scenarios across different feature files
- üèóÔ∏è **Build-Time Processing**: No runtime overhead - scenarios are expanded at build time
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing scenarios with clear warnings
- üìÅ **Flexible File Discovery**: Automatically searches common feature file locations

## Quick Start

### Syntax
Use the following syntax to call scenarios from other features:

```gherkin
Given I call scenario "ScenarioName" from feature "FeatureName"
When I call scenario "ScenarioName" from feature "FeatureName"  
Then I call scenario "ScenarioName" from feature "FeatureName"
And I call scenario "ScenarioName" from feature "FeatureName"
But I call scenario "ScenarioName" from feature "FeatureName"
```

### Basic Example

See the examples folder for complete working examples:
- [examples/BasicUsage](examples/BasicUsage/) - Feature file examples showing the syntax
- [examples/MSTestExample](examples/MSTestExample/) - Complete MSTest project example with step definitions

**Authentication.feature**
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication
    As a user
    I want to be able to login and logout
    So that I can access the application securely

Scenario: Login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in successfully

Scenario: Logout
    Given I am logged in
    When I click the logout button
    Then I should be logged out
```

**UserManagement.feature**
```gherkin
Feature: User Management
    As an administrator
    I want to manage user accounts
    So that I can control access to the system

Scenario: Create New User Account
    Given I call scenario "Login" from feature "Authentication"
    When I navigate to user management
    And I create a new user account
    Then the user should be created successfully
    And I call scenario "Logout" from feature "Authentication"
```

### Generated Output
The scenario call is automatically expanded during build time:

```gherkin
Scenario: Create New User Account
    # Expanded from scenario call: "Login" from feature "Authentication"
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in successfully
    When I navigate to user management
    And I create a new user account
    Then the user should be created successfully
    # Expanded from scenario call: "Logout" from feature "Authentication"
    Given I am logged in
    When I click the logout button
    Then I should be logged out
```

## Installation

### NuGet Package
Install the plugin via NuGet Package Manager:

```bash
dotnet add package JGerits.Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator
```

Or via Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:
```powershell
Install-Package JGerits.Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator
```

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/jgerits/Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator/releases)
2. Add the assembly reference to your test project
3. Ensure the plugin is registered (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

### Automatic Registration
The plugin automatically registers itself with Reqnroll when referenced in your project. No additional configuration is required for basic usage.

### Feature File Discovery
The plugin automatically searches for feature files in the following locations relative to your project:
- Current directory
- `Features/` folder
- `Specs/` folder  
- `Tests/` folder

All searches include subdirectories recursively.

### Project Structure Example
```
MyProject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Features/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication.feature
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserManagement.feature
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shopping/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cart.feature
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkout.feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Specs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Integration/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EndToEnd.feature
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Smoke/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SmokeTests.feature
```

## Advanced Usage

### Error Handling
When a scenario call cannot be resolved, the plugin adds a warning comment instead of failing the build:

```gherkin
Scenario: Test with Missing Reference
    Given I call scenario "NonExistent" from feature "Missing"
    # Warning: Could not expand scenario call
```

### Nested Scenario Calls
Scenarios can contain calls to other scenarios, enabling complex composition:

**BaseOperations.feature**
```gherkin
Feature: Base Operations

Scenario: Setup Test Environment
    Given the application is started
    And the database is clean

Scenario: Complete Login Flow
    Given I call scenario "Setup Test Environment" from feature "Base Operations" 
    When I call scenario "Login" from feature "Authentication"
    Then I should see the dashboard
```

### Case Sensitivity
- Feature names are case-insensitive
- Scenario names are case-insensitive
- File discovery is case-insensitive

## Requirements

- .NET Standard 2.0 or higher
- Reqnroll (compatible with SpecFlow migration)
- MSBuild or .NET CLI for build-time processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Scenario not found
```
# Warning: Could not expand scenario call
```
**Solution**: 
- Verify the feature name matches the `Feature:` declaration exactly
- Ensure the scenario name exists in the target feature file
- Check that the feature file is in a discoverable location

**Issue**: Infinite recursion
**Solution**: Avoid circular references between scenario calls. The plugin does not currently detect circular dependencies.

**Issue**: Feature file not found
**Solution**: 
- Ensure feature files are included in the project build
- Verify the feature file path is in one of the searched directories
- Check file naming conventions (`.feature` extension required)

### Debug Tips
1. Check the generated test files to see expanded scenario content
2. Enable verbose MSBuild logging to see plugin activity
3. Verify feature file discovery paths match your project structure

## Limitations

- Circular scenario call references are not detected
- Scenario Outline templates cannot be called directly (use regular Scenario: instead)
- Scenario calls in `Background:` sections are not expanded (only in `Scenario:` sections)
- Nested scenario calls are not recursively expanded (scenario calls within called scenarios remain as-is)
- Parameters cannot be passed between called scenarios
- Background steps are not included in scenario calls

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0
- Initial release

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and publishing to NuGet.org.

### Automated Workflows

#### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

The pipeline automatically:

1. **On every push to main/master and pull requests**:
   - Sets up .NET 8.0 environment
   - Restores NuGet dependencies
   - Builds the solution in Release configuration
   - Runs all tests
   - Creates NuGet packages
   - Uploads packages as build artifacts

2. **On every push to main/master (automatic releases)**:
   - Automatically increments the patch version (e.g., 3.0.0 ‚Üí 3.0.1)
   - Updates version numbers in the project file
   - Builds and tests with the new version
   - Creates a GitHub release with the new tag
   - Attaches the NuGet package to the release

3. **On GitHub releases**:
   - Downloads the build artifacts
   - Publishes the NuGet package to nuget.org

### Automatic Versioning

**New in this version**: Every commit to the main branch now automatically creates a new release!

The versioning follows the pattern described in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md):
- **MAJOR.MINOR**: Matches the Reqnroll version (e.g., 3.0 for Reqnroll 3.0.x)
- **PATCH**: Automatically incremented on each commit to main (3.0.0 ‚Üí 3.0.1 ‚Üí 3.0.2, etc.)

### Publishing Releases

**Automatic Process** (recommended):
1. Simply push changes to the main branch
2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
   - Increment the patch version
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Publish to NuGet.org

**Manual Process** (for major/minor version changes):
1. Update the version in `Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator.csproj`:
   ```xml
   <Version>4.0.0</Version>
   <AssemblyVersion>4.0.0</AssemblyVersion>
   <FileVersion>4.0.0</FileVersion>
   ```
2. Commit and push to main
3. The pipeline will use your specified version instead of auto-incrementing

### Setup Requirements

To enable automatic publishing, the repository requires a `NUGET_API_KEY` secret containing a valid NuGet.org API key with push permissions.

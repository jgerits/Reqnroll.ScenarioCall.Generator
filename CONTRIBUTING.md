### Commit Message Convention

We use conventional commits for consistency:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add support for scenario outline calls`

## Code Style Guidelines

### C# Code Style

- Follow [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Place opening braces on new lines
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs

### Code Organization

- Keep classes focused and follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Use proper namespacing
- Organize using statements
- Remove unused imports

### Example Code Style

```csharp
namespace Reqnroll.ScenarioCall.Generator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Handles scenario call expansion and validation.
    /// </summary>
    public class ScenarioCallHandler
    {
        private readonly IFeatureFileService _featureFileService;

        public ScenarioCallHandler(IFeatureFileService featureFileService)
        {
            _featureFileService = featureFileService ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(featureFileService));
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Expands a scenario call into its constituent steps.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="scenarioCall">The scenario call to expand.</param>
        /// <returns>The expanded steps or null if not found.</returns>
        public string ExpandScenarioCall(string scenarioCall)
        {
            // Implementation here
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include unit tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for high test coverage on new code
- Tests should be clear, focused, and maintainable

### Test Structure

```csharp
[Fact]
public void MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult()
{
    // Arrange
    var service = new TestService();
    var input = "test input";

    // Act
    var result = service.ProcessInput(input);

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal("expected output", result);
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName"

# Run tests with verbose output
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- Keep README.md up to date with new features
- Add XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include code examples for complex features
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes

### Writing Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Keep documentation current with code changes
- Consider the target audience (developers using the plugin)
